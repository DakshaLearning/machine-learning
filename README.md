# machine-learning
In this repository, I will upload some projects I have been working on. These include the building algorithms from scratch, as well as some applications of these. The suggested order of the notebooks is

1. Linear regression
2. Multiple and polynomial regression
3. Logistic regression
4. Neural networks
5. A note on gradient descent and convergence
6. Stochastic gradient descent
7. K-nearest neighbor
8. K-means
9. Evaluation

Sources: my sources are mainly my notes from Andrew Ng's course and The Elements of Statistical learning by Hastie et al.

Disclaimer: I am not a programmer, so my code is not the most elegant possible. In contrast, as a mathematician, my notebooks will tend to be full of math and equations, so beware.

# machine-learning
In this repository, I will upload some projects I have been working on. These include the building algorithms from scratch, as well as some applications of these.

Disclaimer: I am not a programmer, so my code is not the most elegant possible. In contrast, as a mathematician, my notebooks will tend to be full of math and equations, so beware.
